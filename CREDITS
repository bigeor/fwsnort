Thomas Bullinger        Contributed patches for the --no-jumps option, and
                        wrote the makefwsnort.sh script to download the
                        latest stable snort rules.  Bugfix for correct ip
                        protocol number.  Bugfix for missed --ipt-script
                        option.

Paul O'Neil             Discovered missed DMZ interface code bug.

Ahmad Almulhem          Suggested --ipt-tos and --ipt-mark options, suggested
                        ability to manually specify interface networks
                        instead of automatically parsing the output of
                        ifconfig.  This allows fwsnort to be run on a system
                        where no ip is assigned to an interface such as a
                        linux box that is acting as a bridge.
