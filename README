DESCRIPTION:

fwsnort is a perl script that translates snort rules into equivalent iptables
rules.  Some snort rule options such as "content-list", and "sameip" have no
direct translation into iptables options so not all snort rules can be
translated.  However approximately 80% of all snort signatures can be
successfully translated through the use of the iptables string match module.
Also, included with the fwsnort sources is a patch for the user space portion
of iptables that adds a new option "--hex-string" which accepts an argument
such as "|5a 4e|".  This allows the content fields in snort rules to be
directly input into iptables rulesets from the command line.  fwsnort parses
the running iptables policy on the machine in order to determine which snort
rules are applicable to the specific policy loaded on the machine.

PLATFORMS:

fwsnort is compatible with iptables only, hence fwsnort will exclusively run
on Linux running a 2.4.x series kernel.
